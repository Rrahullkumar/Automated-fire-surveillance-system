# Automated-fire-surveillance-system
1. System Overview
The proposed system utilizes a computer with a webcam to capture video footage of the designated area. The captured video frames will be analyzed for fire presence using a pre-trained fire cascade classifier. Upon fire detection, the system will trigger an alarm sound and send an email notification to a designated recipient for immediate response and awareness.
2. System Components
